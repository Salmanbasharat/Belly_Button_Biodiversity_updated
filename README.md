## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This is a research project to analyze the data for bacterial samples taken from a number of volunteers to identify which bacterial sample is good to make synthetic beef. The bacterial samples have been taken from the *Belly Buttons* of these volunteers and once the right bacteria is identified to make Lab beef then the samples of these volunteers can be matched with that right bacteria.

The bacterial samples have been accumulated on the web page to provide easy access to each volunteer to see the Top 10 bacterial types found in their belly buttons. Once the specific bacteria is identified to make synthetic beef then the volunteers can check their own Top 10 bacterias whether they match with the identified bacteria. Volunteers can select their 'ID' number from drop down menu under "Test Subject Id No:". Once ID is selected, the relevant bacterial cultures in bar and bubble charts are displayed. The volunteers can also see their "Belly Button washing frequency" on the guage chart.
